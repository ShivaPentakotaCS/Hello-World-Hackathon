# Hello-World-Hackathon
A pdf encryptor called Enkryptonite 

The inspiration for nKryptonite came from the lack of a web-based PDF folder encrypting platforms. From our experience, while applying for colleges we had to submit multiple PDFs of sensitive information (i.e. our social security information, passports, immunization records).

However, the issue was that all the web-based encryptors we came across simply couldn’t encrypt an entire folder of sensitive information at once rather than only a single file. That’s where nKryptonite comes into play. 

Our service - nKryptonite - not only encrypts entire folders but also adds an extra layer of security for the more sensitive PDF folders. Using nKryptonite, we can add a second layer of encryption. 

We built the back-end of nKryptonite using the web framework, Flask, and we created the front-end completely from scratch using HTML and CSS.
